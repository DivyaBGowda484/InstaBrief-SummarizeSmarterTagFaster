# AutoDoc: AI-Based Automated Document Summarization and Tagging System

## Overview

**AutoDoc** is an AI-powered tool that automates document summarization and tagging. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to generate concise summaries and contextually relevant tags for documents, making it easier for users to understand and organize large volumes of text data. 

This system can be applied across various industries such as research papers, legal contracts, and corporate reports.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Automatically generates a summary of lengthy documents, focusing on key points and reducing the content size.
- **Contextual Tagging**: Assigns appropriate tags (keywords, entities, and categories) based on the document’s context and content.
- **Multilingual Support**: The system supports document summarization and tagging in multiple languages.
- **Customizable Model**: Users can train the system for domain-specific tagging and summarization (e.g., research papers, contracts, reports).
- **Searchable Database**: Enables users to search for specific keywords or tags and find relevant documents quickly.
- **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Can integrate with platforms like Google Drive, Microsoft Office, or custom document management systems.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **spaCy**: For Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as entity recognition, text tagging, and summarization.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For pre-trained models like BERT, T5, and BART to perform summarization.
- **NLTK**: Used for text preprocessing, tokenization, and other NLP tasks.
- **Sentence-Transformers**: For embedding-based document search and tagging.
- **pyttsx3 / gTTS**: For text-to-speech functionality to read out the generated summaries.
- **Flask**: Web framework to build a simple web app for user interactions.
- **Streamlit**: For an interactive web-based frontend to upload, analyze, and interact with documents.
- **Elasticsearch**: For creating a searchable database of documents and their metadata.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **AWS / Google Cloud**: For cloud-based deployment options.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoDoc-AI-Document-Summarization-Tagging.git
    cd AutoDoc-AI-Document-Summarization-Tagging
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:

    - For Flask:
      ```bash
      flask run
      ```

    - For Streamlit:
      ```bash
      streamlit run frontend/app.py
      ```

## Usage

1. **Upload a Document**: You can upload documents through the web interface (Streamlit or Flask app).
2. **Generate Summary**: The system will analyze the document and generate a concise summary of key points.
3. **Get Tags**: It will automatically assign relevant keywords, entities, and categories based on the content.
4. **Search for Documents**: Use the search functionality to find documents by tags or keywords.

## Multilingual Support

- The summarization and tagging models are designed to support multiple languages. The system can handle documents in languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, and more.
- Ensure that the appropriate multilingual models are selected based on the input language.

## Deployment

- The application can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment. The `Dockerfile` can be used to build and run the app in a container.

### Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t autodoc .
```

## Run the Docker Container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 autodoc
```

This will start the app inside the container and make it available on http://localhost:5000.

## Future Improvements
Enhanced Search: Improve the search feature with more advanced natural language querying.

Customizable Models: Allow users to fine-tune models for specific use cases or industries.

Better Tagging System: Implement hierarchical or semantic tagging for deeper insights.
